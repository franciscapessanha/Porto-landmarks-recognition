# Porto's Landmarks Recognition
The present work proposes an approach for classification and location detection of five Porto landmarks: *Torre dos Clérigos*,
*Casa de Serralves*, *Casa da Música*, *Câmara do Porto*, *Ponte da Arrábida* based on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks Algorithms. 

Additionally, *Casa da Música* images were classified according to the viewpoint from each the photography was taken.
